# QR Code Generator with URL Shortening

## Features
- Generate QR codes from any valid URL
- Shorten URLs using the company domain (http://bonlineco.com/)
- Copy shortened URLs to clipboard
- Download generated QR codes as PNG images
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used
